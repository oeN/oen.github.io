I'm not that good at talking about my self but I'll try it anyway.

During the years I've moved across several programming languages reaching the point where the language itself is not that important anymore, what's matters are just the thoughts behind it.

In recent times I discover that I like more setting up the infrastructure where the code runs rather than writing the code myself, it feels like I can be useful for more people, any project needs good infrastructure to properly works.

I've also started an [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab) (once ready I'll link the page of my actual homelab), right now is a little messy but is constantly improving, we can always improve in some way.

There are a lot of other things that I could say, but for this page, I'll stop here, I have a complicated relationship with social networks so probably you can't find me there; I'm trying to revive my Twitter account, but no promise :P 
Anyway if you're reading this page it means that my site is up and running and I should work on my [blog](/posts), so just look at it and see if you find something interesting!
